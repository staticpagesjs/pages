# @static-pages-js

> This project is currently in development by a single developer. There is much left to do. I plan to stick to this project and release updates and new components as my free time allows.

Yet another static pages generator for small and mid-sized projects written in JavaScript (TypeScript).

It supports a lot of data sources for input
- YAML
- Markdown (front-matter style)
- JSON
- Databases

And a lot of renderers for the output
- Twig
- ejs
- Mustache
- Handlebars
- Pug
- Underscore
- Jade
- Dot

Input readers and output writers are easily extensible allowing you to make your own implementation.
